# Motion Marker 🎨

**Motion Marker** is an interactive, AI-powered hand-tracking drawing application. It allows users to draw on a canvas using simple hand gestures captured via a webcam, leveraging **OpenCV**, **Mediapipe**, and **Numpy**. This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision and AI to create a seamless user interface for gesture-based drawing.

## Features 🚀
- **Hand Tracking**: Uses Mediapipe to track hand movements.
- **Gesture Control**: Allows drawing using your index finger, with color selections and clearing actions based on hand gestures.
- **Real-time Drawing**: Draw and visualize lines in different colors—blue, green, red, and yellow.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple on-screen buttons for color selection and clearing the canvas.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**: For real-time webcam feed and drawing on the canvas.
- **Mediapipe**: To track hand landmarks and detect finger positions.
- **Numpy**: For matrix operations and working with arrays.

## Installation 🖥️

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Numpy

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
